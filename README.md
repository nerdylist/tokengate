# TokenGate

TokenGate is a script built on Next.js and TypeScript that allows you to create a token gate for Cardano NFTs. It provides a mechanism to unlock exclusive content on your website for users who hold a specific NFT in their wallet.

## Overview

The script operates by checking a user's wallet for a specific asset or any asset from a specified policy ID. If the asset or policy ID is found in the user's wallet, the gated content is unlocked and displayed to the user. If the asset or policy ID is not found, the content remains locked.

The script also includes a "Connect Wallet" button for users to connect their Cardano wallet, and a "Hide" link to disconnect the wallet and hide the unlocked content.

## Getting Started

To get started with TokenGate, you can clone the project from the GitHub repository and follow the instructions in the README to install and run the project locally.

## Learn More

TokenGate is built on the MeshJS library, which provides a set of tools and APIs for interacting with the Cardano blockchain. You can learn more about MeshJS and its capabilities on the MeshJS website.
